Gen-220-Project
What are the goals of this project?
	
	1.Determinine percent incomplete for each taxa
	2.Converted a Nexus file into TNT format 
	3.Look at support (or compare to Master Tree) when using taxa at different levels of completeness (50%+, 40%+, etc.) 
	4.Rewrite PAUP constraints to work in TNT (TNT starts at 0, PAUP starts at 1) 
	
Where should I start?
	1.Make a small dataset to test on
	2.Get is on the cluster
	3.Start with Goals
